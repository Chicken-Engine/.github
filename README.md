# `Chickn Engine`

## What is `Chickn Engine`?
`Chickn Engine` is a [FNF](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) engine entirely build from the [week 7 release of the game.](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/tree/legacy/0.2.x)

## When should we expect releases?
There's no schedule really, it's mainly when it's ready it's out.
I like to finish and get rid of any bugs I find before releasing it but I'm not always going to find every single bug, that's why I have the crash log sender.
